# Classification
Bachelor Thesis - Physical Activity Classification in Children Using Machine Learning

The "Final_main" file contains the final code for summing up the whole project. The file includes confusion matrix for all classifier models, ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves and AUC (Area Under the ROC curve) scores along with metric tables for comparing each classes and average scores.

Keep in mind that all models and their final results are reproducible except for the Multilayer Perceptron, due to its training process being randomixed each run.
